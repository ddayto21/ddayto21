Over the past six years, I’ve built software at high-growth startups, often in the unglamorous but critical parts of the stack—onboarding flows, CI/CD pipelines, build systems, and the infrastructure that keeps teams moving fast. My focus is on solving problems at scale by designing systems that simplify complexity and create lasting impact. I drive mobile engineering at WOLF, where our multi-tenant platform powers labor marketplaces for global workforces.
