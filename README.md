I architect scalable systems that unlock organizational leverage. Over six years leading engineering at high-growth startups, I've built multi-tenant platforms serving millions—designing deployment infrastructure, authentication systems, and CI/CD automation that eliminated significant manual overhead while maintaining uptime. My work focuses on transforming engineering organizations: converting brittle processes into resilient systems, reducing cycle times from weeks to hours, and turning infrastructure complexity into competitive advantage.

## Technical Specialities

**Platform Architecture**: Designed multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure powering 50+ white-labeled mobile applications across North America, establishing standards that reduced agency onboarding cycles by 30% and increased release velocity by 35%.

**Deployment Systems**: Built automated release pipelines delivering 1,000+ production deployments with near-zero regression rates, eliminating manual version management and reducing deployment cycles from 90 minutes to under 30.

**Business Impact**: Drove measurable outcomes across the stack—40% latency reduction for Dubai's largest airline, 20% reduction in enterprise supply chain costs, 35% improvement in production reliability through comprehensive testing infrastructure.

**Technical Strategy**: Partner with executive leadership to align engineering investments with business objectives, translating organizational friction into automation opportunities and technical debt into platform leverage.
