I'm a Senior Full-Stack Developer passionate about building innovative, scalable solutions that solve real-world problems and create impact. I enjoy working with technologies like Next.js, React, and Python and thrive on integrating frontend and backend systems to deliver seamless user experiences. My goal is to leverage technology to drive progress and create platforms that connect and empower people.

In addition to development, I’m currently focused on starting a business in the logistics space, with a vision to revolutionize the way shippers and carriers connect.
